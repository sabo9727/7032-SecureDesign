# 7032-SecureDesign

# Practical Element Brief
    A pharmaceutical company has hired you to develop a web-based application/software that enables
the costumers to see the history of the medicines ordered using personal accounts, search and order
new medicines, and update their medical record and prescriptions. The requirements for the system are
as follows:
    •Design the system under consideration incorporating the principles of secure design and development
    •Develop the designed system complying with the required standards and methodologies.
    •Apply testing and analysis techniques to the developed system.
    •Apply Formal Methods to different stages of the system development life cycle.

# Practical Element Information
    During the practical/lab sessions, you will be required to complete a set of workshops that will help you
to familirise yourself with the tools and practices needed for the completion of the practical element,
which covers all the learning outcomes. Your work will be marked using the provided grading rubric.
Evidence for Practical Element
    1) Design (25%):
        a. Produce a prototype for the system to be implemented and explain what design and security principles have been considered and why.
        b. Describe how the chosen principles or features enhance the functioning and security of that system in this stage of the development life-cycle.
    2) Development (25%):
        a. Produce an application that complies with the design provided in the previous task.
        b. Demonstrate the proper functioning and security mechanisms of the developed system in accordance with the existing secure development standards and methodologies.
    3) Security (25%):
        a. Demonstrate the use of testing and analysis techniques applied to the developed system, such as code testing, static and dynamic analysis, etc.
        b. Propose solutions for the issues discovered during the testing and analysis process showing how they can mitigate the detected problems.
    4) Formal Methods (25%):
        a. Use formal methods, specifically automata, to produce the behavioural model of the system that will be based on the design or development stage of the system life-cycle.
        b. Convert the automata model into the respective Petri net model and then verify the correctness of the system with respect to its using the appropriate verification techniques and tools.
